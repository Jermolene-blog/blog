I cut my teeth on the home computers of the late 1970's. I've been CTO of several startups, Head of Ecommerce for an investment bank, and Head of Open Source Innovation at BT plc, and recently celebrated 10 years as the leader of the TiddlyWiki open source project. My passion is building tools that extend the capabilities of individuals and groups. I am based in Oxford, UK.
